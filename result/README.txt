I use the snp matrix as input, and I compress them to be a picture
and then applied two CNN models(simple and a more advanced) into the picture.
the loss change and the structure of the CNN is shown in the folder

Why CNNs Can Be Effective for SNP Matrices:
Pattern Recognition: CNNs excel at recognizing patterns and spatial hierarchies in data. SNP matrices, when visualized, can be thought of as images where patterns of genetic variation across individuals (rows) and loci (columns) might correspond to underlying genetic structures or relationships. CNNs can potentially learn these patterns to predict related phenotypic or genetic parameters like theta, which measures genetic variation.

Local Correlations: In SNP data, correlations between nearby loci (due to linkage disequilibrium) can be crucial for understanding genetic structure. CNNs inherently leverage local spatial correlations through their convolutional filters, making them apt for capturing these relationships in a way that's analogous to detecting edges or textures in images.

Scalability and Generalization: CNNs can handle input data of varying sizes (through techniques like padding or resizing) and generalize well from training data to unseen data, assuming proper training, regularization, and validation. This capability allows them to learn from complex genetic datasets and make predictions on new data.

Making Sense of the CNN Structure for SNP Data:
Input Layer: The input to the CNN is a 2D SNP matrix, possibly treated as a single-channel grayscale image or expanded to mimic a 3-channel RGB image for compatibility with common CNN architectures. Each "pixel" in this image represents a genetic variant (SNP), with its intensity corresponding to the allele frequency or genotype presence.

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply a series of filters to the input, creating feature maps that represent detected patterns. In the context of SNP data, these could correspond to specific patterns of genetic variation or linkage disequilibrium across loci. Stacking multiple convolutional layers allows the network to learn increasingly complex patterns.

Pooling Layers: Following convolutional layers, pooling (typically max pooling) reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps, helping to make the detection of patterns more invariant to small shifts and distortions. This step can abstract away from individual SNP variations to broader patterns of genetic structure.

Fully Connected Layers: After several rounds of convolution and pooling, the high-level information extracted from the SNP matrix is flattened and fed through one or more fully connected layers. These layers integrate the learned patterns to make a final prediction about the theta value. This part of the network essentially decides how the detected patterns of genetic variation relate to the quantitative measure of genetic diversity (theta).

Output Layer: The final layer outputs a prediction for theta. This could be a single node in a regression setup, where the network predicts a continuous value representing the genetic variation.

By treating SNP matrices as images and applying CNNs, the model leverage the network's ability to learn complex patterns in data. The analogy to image processing lies in the recognition of patterns and structures within the dataâ€”just as edges, textures, and shapes inform image classification, patterns of genetic variation inform the prediction of theta. The success of this approach depends on the presence of meaningful patterns in the SNP data that correlate with theta, the quality and quantity of the data, and the adequacy of the CNN architecture and training process.
